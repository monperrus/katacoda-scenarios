## Pi-hole with Docker

This scenario was created as part of a university course. Pi-hole is a very good and interesting service that removes ads on a network-wide level and together with Docker it is very ease to install and get going. I made this tutorial to guide users that are somewhat comfortable with the command line interface in creating a Pi-hole service on their device using Docker.
