# Finishing up

Now you're done! You have successfully started the Pi-hole service on your device.


### Doing port forwarding (if you do this on your own device)

What's left now is for you to point your DNS traffic to the device, this can be done via your router settings. It will, however, be very different depending on your router.

One first step is in your router settings to set a static IP address for your device that is running Pi-hole. Search for your router and "static DHCP" to find out how.

Then search for your router model and "change DNS" to find specific guides for how to set the DNS server for your router, or take a look in your router's manual. Then all you have to do is to set the DNS server to the address of the device you have Pi-hole running on and you're done.
